# landing_page

Hello there,

This project is the beginning of my portfolio website. I hope to use this main page as a resume with links to other personal projects. This is the beginning.

For now, I'm filling it up with random images and things so that I could practice coding and building a full website. Eventually, I want to integrate my information on here.

I have completed the basic layout of the site. 
Next step will be to adjust colors, fonts and sizings.

Then, I will begin work on other projects to fill out my portfolio site.
